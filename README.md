# Clinical ML System: MIMIC-III Analysis with LLM Fine-tuning and AWS Deployment

A comprehensive clinical machine learning system that analyzes publicly available healthcare datasets (MIMIC-III) to predict patient outcomes, fine-tunes Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract structured information from unstructured clinical notes, and deploys production-ready ML pipelines on AWS SageMaker with automated monitoring, logging, and retraining capabilities.

## 🏥 Project Overview

This project demonstrates end-to-end clinical ML pipeline development:

- **Patient Outcome Prediction**: Using MIMIC-III dataset for predicting critical clinical outcomes

- Medications and procedures
- Clinical notes and discharge summaries
- ICD-9 diagnoses and procedures

## 🔬 Models

### Predictive Models
- **Mortality Prediction**: ICU mortality prediction using physiological time series
- **Length of Stay Prediction**: Hospital stay duration estimation
- **Readmission Risk**: 30-day readmission probability

### Benchmark Implementation

## 🤖 LLM Fine-tuning

### Clinical Information Extraction
Fine-tuning Large Language Models for structured information extraction from clinical notes.

**Key Approaches:**
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Medical entity extraction
- **Relation Extraction**: Clinical relationships and dependencies
- **Text Classification**: Clinical note categorization
- **Information Synthesis**: Structured data generation from unstructured text
